What I am looking for is that you have a Fact class.
 For every fact that is scraped, there should be an instance 
 of the fact class created that holds the information about the fact.
  So I would expect that an instance of the plant class would have an 
  attribute of content for example. The content attribute would hold 
  the text of the fact. Then you would use those instances that were
   created to display the facts to the user. I'm looking for the app to 
   be object-oriented, meaning you are creating instances of a class and 
   using those instances to store information and display them to the user.
